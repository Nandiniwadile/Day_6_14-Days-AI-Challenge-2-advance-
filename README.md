# 🚀 14 Days AI Challenge – 2  
## 📅 Day 6: Model Training & Tuning

This project is part of the **14 Days AI Challenge – 2**.

On Day 6, we focused on training machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Train a Logistic Regression model  
- Train a Random Forest model  
- Perform Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Compare models using AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)

## 🧠 What is Model Training?

Model training is the process of teaching a machine learning model using data so it can learn patterns and make predictions.

---

## ⚙️ What is Model Tuning?

Model tuning involves adjusting hyperparameters to improve model performance and accuracy.

Examples:
- Logistic Regression → C, solver  
- Random Forest → n_estimators, max_depth  

---

## 📊 Model Comparison

We evaluated models using **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)**.

- Higher AUC indicates better performance.
- Random Forest generally achieved better results compared to Logistic Regression.
